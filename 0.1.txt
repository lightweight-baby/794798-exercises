Save gets clicked
Form gets submitted via post method to https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note

The server does sth with the data, my best guess is adding it to a database because it is still visible after multiple reloads

Server responds with a 302 status code, which calls for a redirect to the initial location, namely /exampleapp/notes
This reloads the initial page.


browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
server-->browser: HTML-code
browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
server-->browser: main.css
browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
server-->browser: main.js

js code calls for getting (altered) jason data from server, so

browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
server-->browser: data.json
browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/favicon.ico
server-->browser: favicon.ico

when the data has been fetched, the browser executes an event handler, which renders the notes to the page using the DOM-API

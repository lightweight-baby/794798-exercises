Full-stack wd

All my exercises can be found in this repository, in their specific folders.
lightweight baby and beghosted are both the same person, aka me, aka Patrik. I just havent figured out how to change my github account in the command prompt. Lightweight baby changes are changes done direcly in the browser, I'm apprently using a different account here.

I did a mistake in the submission system: instead of marking all completed exercises with a check, I only checked the number of exercises I did. Can you please get in touch with me about this issue? patrik.jungling@aalto.fi

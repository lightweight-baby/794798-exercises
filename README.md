# My Submission repository
Full-stack wd

I cleaned up my submissions after the third exercise, using different folders for each exercise.

Can you please get in touch with me about the submission system? I didnt mark all completed exercises. E.g. in exercise 3, I only set a check for 21 because I thought this meant that I completed 21 parts in total. patrik.jungling@aalto.fi is my mail.
